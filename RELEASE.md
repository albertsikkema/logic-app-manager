# Release Instructions

This document explains how to create and publish a new release of Logic App Manager.

## Pre-Release Checklist

## Version Numbering

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

## Creating a Release

2. Commit the version change:
   ```bash
   git add manifest.json
   git commit -m "Bump version to 1.1.0"
   ```

### Step 2: Create Package

Run the package script:

```bash
./package.sh
```

This creates a ZIP file: `logic-app-manager-v1.1.0.zip`

### Step 3: Test the Package

   - Restore uploads and applies changes
   - UI displays correctly

### Step 4: Create Git Tag

```bash
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Release version 1.1.0"
git push origin main
git push origin v1.1.0
```

## Troubleshooting

### Package script fails

Make sure the script is executable:
```bash
chmod +x package.sh
```

### ZIP file too large

The package should be under 1MB. If larger, check for:
- Unnecessary files being included
- Large image files
- Development artifacts

### Git push rejected

Make sure you've committed all changes:
```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for release"
git push
```

## Automated Releases (Future)

Consider setting up GitHub Actions for automated releases:
- Automatically create ZIP on tag push
- Run tests before release
- Auto-generate changelog

See `.github/workflows/release.yml` (to be created)
