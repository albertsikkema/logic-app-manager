> "Thank you for reporting this! We're investigating and will release a fix in version X.X.X. You can track progress at [GitHub issue link]."

*For feature requests*:
> "Great suggestion! We've added this to our roadmap. Track progress at [GitHub issue link] and feel free to contribute if interested!"

## Troubleshooting

### Package script fails

Make sure the script is executable:
```bash
chmod +x package.sh
```

### ZIP file too large

The package should be under 1MB. If larger, check for:
- Unnecessary files being included
- Large image files
- Development artifacts

### Git push rejected

Make sure you've committed all changes:
```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for release"
git push
```

## Automated Releases (Future)

Consider setting up GitHub Actions for automated releases:
- Automatically create ZIP on tag push
- Run tests before release
- Auto-generate changelog

See `.github/workflows/release.yml` (to be created)
